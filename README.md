# Cast2Gif

A tool to convert [Asciinema](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema) cast file to Gif, animated PNG, or SVG files *without* using Electron or a web browser.

This is still a work-in-progress. Discussion is happening on a [forum topic](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/suggested-libraries-for-writing-an-asciinema-to-gif-tool/39450?u=zicklag) on the Rust forum.
